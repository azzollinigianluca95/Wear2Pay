**Wear2Pay** <br/> 
Android Mobile Smartwatch application developed in Java programming language. The aim is to connect a vendor machine simulated by a specific mobile application (on an Android smartphone), to a wearOS smartwatch, developing a smartwatch application called Wear2Pay. The connection is established by Bluetooth protocol.
The user will be able to log into Wear2Pay system leveraging Internet connection, check if there is sufficient credit, and then be able to buy one of the different available products on the vendor machine, directly from the smartwatch.
